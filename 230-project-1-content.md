# The Climb # 

## I. High Concept  ##
+ A verticle, endless runner(ish) with platforms.
+ Ninja Jump meets Mario
## II. Genre ##
+ Action
+ Casual
+ Endless runner (ish)
+ Platform
## III. Platform ##
+ Desktop game designed for keyboard but hoping for a Mobile port ~~if I can figure out a controll scheme.~~
## IV. Story ## 
+ There is no story. 
+ The characters motivation is to avoid the growing darkness from below that progresses faster the longer the game gets.
+ The players motivation is to just get as high as possible, collecting coins to unlock cosmetics, and possibly power-up ~~(if i can come up with some)~~
## V. Esthetics ##
+ The graphics style is going to be cartoonish with the character being stick figure.
+ The sound will be upbeat, 8-bit music that gets more and more hectic the closer the character is to the darkness.
## VI. Gameplay ##
+ The game will include 
  + Varible Interval and Ratio Reward Schedules for achievement based currency boosts.
  + Pride for achievements.
